##### Question 1. 

The built in billboard dataset is not tidy. Describe why it is not tidy and then tidy the dataset.

```{r question-1-response}

# First gather up all the week entries into a row for each week for each song (where there is an entry)


# Then, convert the week variable to a number and figure out the date corresponding to each week on the chart


# Sort the data by artist, track and week. Here are what your first entries should be (formatting can be different):
#>  A tibble: 5,307 x 5
#   artist  track                   date.entered  week  rank   date
 #    <chr>   <chr>                   <date>       <int> <dbl>   <date>

##### Question 2. 

Tidy the "fish_encounters" dataset of fish spotting by monitoring stations. Make the NA into 0 using the option "values_fill = list(seen = 0)"


```{r question-2-response}

```

##### Question 3. 

Import the flowers1 dataset. Tidy and pivot the data. Hint: use "read_csv2()" to read in the dataset 

```{r question-3-response}

```

##### Question 4.

Import the flowers2 dataset. Tidy the dataset by turning the one column into 3 separate columns

```{r question-4-response}

```

##### Question 5.

In the following dataset, turn the implicit missing values to explicit 

```{r question-5-response}
output <- tibble(
      treatment   = c("a", "b", "a", "c", "b"),
      gender   = factor(c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M"), levels = c("M", "F", "O")),
      return = c(1.5, 0.75,  0.5,  1.8,  NA)
    )
output
```


#####Question 6.

Import the weather dataset as weather. Use "pivot_longer()" to put the days all in one column, then use "pivot_wider" to separate tmax and tmin into separate columns. Print the summary of the final resulting dataset 

```{r question-6-response}

```

###### Question 7. 

Load the built in "anscombe" data frame and use "pivot_longer()" to separate all the x and y columns and categorize them into 4 sets

```{r question-7-response}

```
