#### Part 1 - Basic Exploration of US Data

The New York Times (the Times) has aggregated reported COVID-19 data from state and local governments and health departments since 2020 and provides public access through a repository on GitHub. One of the data sets provided by the Times is county-level data for cumulative cases and deaths each day. This will be your primary data set for the first two parts of your analysis. 

County-level COVID data from 2020, 2021, and 2022 has been imported below. Each row of data reports the cumulative number of cases and deaths for a specific county each day. A FIPS code, a standard geographic identifier, is also provided which you will use in Part 2 to construct a map visualization at the county level for a state. 

Additionally, county-level population estimates reported by the US Census Bureau has been imported as well. You will use these estimates to caluclate statistics per 100,000 people. 

```{r import-nyt-data}
# Import New York Times COVID-19 data
# Import Population Estimates from US Census Bureau 

us_counties_2020 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2020.csv")
us_counties_2021 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2021.csv")
us_counties_2022 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2022.csv")

us_population_estimates <- read_csv("fips_population_estimates.csv")
```

##### Question 1 

Your first task is to combine and tidy the 2020, 2021, and 2022 COVID data sets and find the total deaths and cases for each day since March 15, 2020 (2020-03-15). The data sets provided from the NY Times also includes statistics from Puerto Rico, a US territory. You may remove these observations from the data as they will not be needed for your analysis. Once you have tidied the data, find the total COVID-19 cases and deaths since March 15, 2020. Write a sentence or two after the code block communicating your results. Use inline code to include the `max_date`, `us_total_cases`, and `us_total_deaths` variables. To write inline code use `r `. 

```{r p1q1-response}

# Combine and tidy the 2020, 2021, and 2022 COVID data sets. 
# Hint: Review the rbind() documentation to combine the three data sets. 
#
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

max_date <- '' # replace the quotes with your code to find the most recent date in the data set
us_total_cases <- ''
us_total_deaths <- ''


```

```{r p1q1-sample}

# Your output should look similar to the following tibble: 
#
#   A tibble: 657 x 3
#       date          total_deaths   total_cases
#      <date>            <dbl>         <dbl>
#   1 2020-03-15           68          3595

#   4 2020-03-18          162          8345
#   5 2020-03-19          212         12387
#   6 2020-03-20          277         17998

#   8 2020-03-22          457         33050
#   9 2020-03-23          577         43474
#  10 2020-03-24          783         53899

As of `r format(max_date, "%B %d, %Y")`, ... 

##### Question 2 

Create a visualization for the total number of deaths and cases in the US since March 15, 2020. Before you create your visualization, review the types of plots you can create using the ggplot2 library and think about which plots would be effective in communicating your results. After you have created your visualization, write a few sentences describing your visualization. How could the plot be interpreted? Could it be misleading? 

```{r p1q2-response}

# Create a visualization for the total number of US cases and deaths since March 15, 2020. 
#
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

```

-- Communicate your methodology, results, and interpretation here -- 

##### Question 3

While it is important to know the total deaths and cases throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also important for local and state health officials to know the the number of new cases and deaths each day to understand how rapidly the virus is spreading. Using the table you created in Question 1, calculate the number of new deaths and cases each day and a seven-day average of new deaths and cases. Once you have organized your data, find the days that saw the largest number of new cases and deaths. Write a sentence or two after the code block communicating your results.

```{r p1q3-response}

# Create a new table, based on the table from Question 1, and calculate the number of new deaths and cases each day and a seven day average of new deaths and cases. 
#
# Hint: Look at the documentation for lag() when computing the number of new deaths and cases and the seven-day averages. 
#
#
## YOUR CODE HERE ##

max_new_cases_date <- ''
max_new_deaths_date <- ''

```

```{r p1q3-sample}

#  Your output should look similar to the following tibble: 
#  
#  date
#  total_deaths     >  the cumulative number of deaths up to and including the associated date
#  total_cases      >  the cumulative number of cases up to and including the associated date
#  delta_deaths_1   >  the number of new deaths since the previous day
#  delta_cases_1    >  the number of new cases since the previous day
#  delta_deaths_7   >  the average number of deaths in a seven-day period
#  delta_cases_7    >  the average number of cases in a seven-day period

##### Question 4


```{r p1q4-response}

# Create a new table, based on the table from Question 3, and calculate the number of new deaths and cases per 100,000 people each day and a seven day average of new deaths and cases per 100,000 people. 

# Hint: To calculate per 100,000 people, first tidy the population estimates data and calculate the US population in 2020 and 2021. Then, you will need to divide  each statistic by the estimated population and then multiply by 100,000.
#
# Hint: look at the help documentation for grepl() and case_when() to divide the averages by the US population for each year. 
# For example, take the simple tibble, t_new: 
#
#     x     y   
#   <int> <chr>  
#     1     a   
#     2     b   
#     3     a    
#     4     b  
#     5     a  
#     6     b
#
#
# To add a column, z, that is dependent on the value in y, you could: 
#
# t_new %>%  
#   mutate(z = case_when(grepl("a", y) ~ "not b", 
#                        grepl("b", y) ~ "not a"))

##### Part 2 - US State Comparison

While understanding the trends on a national level can be helpful in understanding how COVID-19 impacted the United States, it is important to remember that the virus arrived in the United States at different times. For the next part of your analysis, you will begin to look at COVID related deaths and cases at the state and county-levels.

##### Question 1

Your first task in Part 2 is to determine the top 10 states in terms of total deaths and cases between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021.

Once you have both lists, briefly describe your methodology and your results.

```{r p2q1-response}

# Determine the top 10 states in terms of total deaths and cases between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021. To do this, transform your combined COVID-19 data to summarize total deaths and cases by state up to December 31, 2021. 

```

```{r p2q1-sample}

# Your transformed data should look similar to the following tibble:  
#
# A tibble: 51 x 4
#     state                  date       total_deaths  total_cases
#     <chr>                 <date>          <dbl>       <dbl>

##### Question 2

Determine the top 10 states in terms of deaths per 100,000 people and cases per 100,000 people between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021.

Once you have both lists, briefly describe your methodology and your results. Do you expect the lists to be different than the one produced in Question 1? Which method, total or per 100,000 people, is a better method for reporting the statistics? 

```{r p2q2-response}

# Determine the top 10 states in terms of deaths and cases per 100,000 people between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021. You should first tidy and transform the population estimates to include population totals by state. Use your relational data verbs (e.g. full_join()) to join the population estimates with the cases and death statistics using the state name as a key. Then, use case_when() and grepl() to add a population column to your table that only includes the estimated population for the associated year. Finally, mutate your table to calculate deaths and cases per 100,000 people and summarize by state. 

```

```{r p2q2-sample}

# Your transformed data should look similar to the following tibble:

##### Question 3

Now, select a state and calculate the seven-day averages for new cases and deaths per 100,000 people. Once you have calculated the averages, create a visualization using ggplot2 to represent the data. 

```{r p2q3-response}

# Select a state and then filter by state and date range your data from Question 1. Calculate the seven-day average following the same procedure as Part 1. 


```

##### Question 4

Using the same state, identify the top 5 counties in terms of deaths and cases per 100,000 people. 

```{r p2q4-response}

# Using the same state as Question 2, filter your state and date range from the combined data set from Part 1 and summarize cases and deaths. Produce two lists arranged by deaths and cases. When transforming the data, be sure to include the "fips" column as you will need this to complete Question 5. 

```

```{r p2q4-sample}

##### Question 5

Modify the code below for the map projection to plot county-level deaths and cases per 100,000 people for your state. 

```{r p2q5-response}

```

```{r p2q5-sample}
# Copy and modify the code below for your state.
#
# plot_usmap arguments: 
#   regions: can be one of ("states", "state", "counties", "county"). The default is "states"
#   include: The regions to include in the resulting map. If regions is "states"/"state", the value can be either a state name, abbreviation or FIPS code. For counties, the FIPS must be provided as there can be multiple counties with the same name. 
#   data: values to plot on the map
#   values: the name of the column that contains the values to be associated with a given region. 
#   color: the map outline color.
#
# Reference the plot_usmap documentation for further information using ?plot_usmap

plot_usmap(regions = "county", include="CO", data = colorado_county, values = "total_deaths", color = "blue") +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "blue", name = "Deaths per 100,000")

#### Part 3 - Global Comparison

```{r import-csse}
# Import global COVID-19 statistics aggregated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.
# Import global population estimates from the World Bank.

csse_global_deaths <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv")
csse_global_cases <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")

globabl_population_estimates <- read_csv("global_population_estimates.csv")
```

##### Question 1

Using the state you selected in Part 2 Question 2 compare the daily number of cases and deaths reported from the CSSE and NY Times. 

```{r p3q1-response}

# To compare your state data between the two data sets, you will first need to tidy the US CSSE death and cases data.
# Hint: Review the documentation for pivot_longer().


# Once you have tidied your data, join the two CSSE US data sets to include cases and deaths in one table. 


# Finally, create two visualizations with one plotting the CSSE and NY Times cases and the other plotting the CSEE and NY Times deaths.

```

```{r p3q1-sample}

# Your tidied CSSE data for your selected state should look similar to the following tibble:
#
# A tibble: 43,362 × 6
#     fips  county  state        date      cases  deaths
#     <dbl> <chr>   <chr>       <date>     <dbl>  <dbl>
#  1  8001  Adams  Colorado   2020-03-15     6      0
#  2  8001  Adams  Colorado   2020-03-16     8      0
#  3  8001  Adams  Colorado   2020-03-17    10      0

##### Question 2 

Now that you have verified the data reported from the CSSE and NY Times are similar, combine the global and US CSSE data sets and identify the top 10 countries in terms of deaths and cases per 100,000 people between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021.

```{r p3q2-response}

# First, combine and tidy the CSSE death and cases data sets. You may wish to keep the two sets separate.
# Then, tidy the global population estimates. While tidying your data, remember to include columns that you will be able to use when joining the COVID-19 data. 
# You will notice that the population estimates data does not include every country reported in the CSSE data. When calculating statistics per 100,000 people, you will need to filter the CSSE data to only include countries that you have population estimates for. 

```

##### Question 3

Construct a visualization plotting the 10 countries in terms of deaths and cases per 100,000 people between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021. In designing your visualization keep the number of data you will be plotting in mind. You may wish to create two separate visualizations, one for deaths and another for cases. 

```{r p3q3-response}

```

-- Communicate your methodology, results, and interpretation here -- 

##### Question 4

Finally, select four countries from one continent and create visualizations for the daily number of confirmed cases per 100,000 and the daily number of deaths per 100,000 people between March 15, 2020, and December 31, 2021.
