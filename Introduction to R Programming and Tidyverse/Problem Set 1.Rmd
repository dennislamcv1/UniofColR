### Introduction

Reference the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) while completing the exercises. 

Review Sections 2.1-2.5 from Hands-On Programming in R and Sections 3.1 - 3.4 from Hands-On Programming in R and complete the following exercises. These exercises are ungraded.


#### Question 1. 

Write a roll function that simulates rolling two six-sided die. The function should contain no input arguments.

#### Question 2.

Rewrite the roll function to include an argument for the type of die (e.g. three-, six-, eight-sided). Think about what other input arguments should be allowed. How would you update your function to include them? 

#### Question 3. 

Produce a historgram of 50,000 rolls of three eight-sided fair dice. 

#### Question 4. 

Produce a historgram of 50,000 rolls of three eight-sided dice where the dice are loaded so that the number 7 has a higher probability of being rolled than the other numbers, assume all the other numbers have a 1/10 probability of being rolled.

#### Question 5. 

Rewrite the "rescale01()" function such that -Inf is mapped to 0 and Inf is mapped to 1.

#### Question 6.

Write both_na(), a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns the number of positions that have an NA in both vectors.
