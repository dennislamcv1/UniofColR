Using the nycflights13 data, calculate a new variable called "hr_delay" and arrange the flights dataset in order of the arrival delays in hours (longest delays at the top). Put the new variable you created just before the departure time. Hint: use the experimental argument .before. 

#### Question 2. 

What proportion of flights in nycflights13 are delayed by more than on hour?
